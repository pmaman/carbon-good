        description:"CarbonGood uses elevated CO2 levels in fossil ,fuel emissions to accelerate biomass growth, coupling that with optimized lighting and extended daylight to produce a virtuous cycle. HCCAS is also a high-density format yielding much more biomass, much faster, from each square foot of land than any other agricultural solution can do, enabling it to lock-up megatons of carbon in useful product. And do so cleanly, with no pollution, no pesticide, and no herbicide."

        description:"CarbonGood uses established off-the-shelf and cost-effective technology to safely capture CO2 from any emitter or directly from the air with zero pollution. We convert captured CO2 on-site to biomass and then to a high value, immediately usable product (biochar) that is in growing demand."

        title:"Biomass to Biochar",
        description:"Biocharring the biomass permanently sequesters carbon as valuable products (emissions from the charring process are also captured). Biomass height is constrained by the format but grasses, cereals and other fast-growing species work, and work well. Another option is industrial hemp which, among many other uses, is  the raw material for carbon-negative hempcrete, a material that permanently locks-up CO2 in buildings."
